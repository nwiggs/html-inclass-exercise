# HTML Starter Assignment  
_Master of Science in Health Informatics — Application Development_

Welcome! This repository contains the starter files for your first hands‑on HTML assignment in our flipped‑classroom course. You will extend the provided template, practice core HTML skills, and build a small multi‑page site using proper structure, images, and relative links.

---

## 📁 Repository Contents

```
/
├── index.html        # Home page with boilerplate + navigation
├── about.html        # Page with a list and a simple form
├── gallery.html      # Page demonstrating images + captions
├── images/
│   ├── sample-1.jpg  # Placeholder images to practice paths
│   └── sample-2.jpg
└── README.md        # Student reference instructions
```

You will **modify and expand** these files as part of your assignment.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By completing this assignment, you will be able to:

- Create valid HTML5 documents with proper `<head>` and `<body>` structure  
- Insert images using **relative paths**  
- Create **multi‑page navigation** using `<a>` anchor tags  
- Organize files using directories and subdirectories  
- Understand and fix broken links caused by incorrect paths  

---

## 🚀 Your Tasks

### **1. Explore the Starter Files**
- Open `index.html` in your browser.
- Browse all pages to understand how they connect.

---

### **2. Customize Content**
Replace sample text with your own on all three pages:

- **`index.html`**  
  Update headings, paragraphs, and navigation labels.

- **`about.html`**  
  Replace the list and form content with your own relevant information.

- **`gallery.html`**  
  Replace placeholder images *or* add your own to the `images/` folder.

---

### **3. Add Your Own Images**
- Place at least **one new image** into the `images/` directory.
- Use a proper `<img>` element:
  ```html
  <img href='images/myphoto.jpg' alt='Alt text  here'/>
  ```
- Every image **must** have a meaningful `alt` attribute.

---

### **4. Create One New Page**
Create a fourth HTML file, such as:

- `contact.html`  
- `projects.html`  
- `interests.html`  

Add at least **one new HTML structure**, such as:
- A list  
- A table  
- A form  
- A figure with caption  

Then update the `<nav>` on every page to include a link to your new file.

---

## 🧪 How to Check Your Work

Open each page in a browser and verify:

- All pages load correctly  
- Navigation links work everywhere  
- Images appear (no broken icons)  
- All text is your own  
- Your additional page is reachable via the nav bar  
- HTML indentation is clean and readable  

HTML validation (optional):
